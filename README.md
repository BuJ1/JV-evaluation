# JV-evaluation

An easy to use GUI to evaluate and sort out current voltage curves used in photovoltaic research,
go through external quantum efficiency files and fit UV-vis spectroscopy files. This project
was realised during a master's thesis to facilitate data evaluation as a hobby project. It is not maintained or updated. However, please feel free to use the code.

## General Idea

I figured that the easiest way to think about JV curves is by directly having a look at them in groups
and select and unselect them by simply clicking on them in the graphs. If you produce a batch of solar
cells you would, however, first define different subsets or groups of solar cells. After checking the
validity of the curves you can then proceed by comparing the efficiency data. Keep in mind that this
program is tailored to a certain data file structure. Nevertheless, it shouldn't be a big deal to
change it so that it fits your needs.
